    <p class="heading"> Pain & Palliative Medicine</p>
    <p class="contained">Pain in cancer, involves both the physical and the psychological. While the threshold of pain is different for each person, cancer patients and their care-givers, need immense support in its management.
      A patient diagnosed with cancer is riddled with the fear of physical pain that often accompanies the disease. It can also wreak havoc with the patient’s emotional balance leading to anxiety, fear, despair, sadness, mental isolation, etc.
       <br>
      This is where pain management specialists at Fortis’ Pain and Palliative Medicine department step in to make the treatment process relatively pain-free.  They counsel the patient and the caregivers on how to handle the pain of cancer and the accompanying mental trauma. The Pain and Palliative Medicine team seeks to relieve pain through a systematic yet simple, predetermined program that follows minimal use of pain relieving drugs, hence avoiding side-effects, as well as non-drug treatments. The aim, after all, is to allow the patient to lead a normal routine all through the treatment process, without compromising on the quality of life.
      <br>
      <p class="heading">Integrative Oncology</p>
     <p class="contained">Integrative oncology focuses on the inter-connection between the cancer and the biochemical areas within the body that it lives and grows on. Hence, this mode of cancer treatment involves the combination of the best of modern medicine and natural, evidence-based alternative therapies to best relieve pain and stem the cancer in its growth path. This integrative approach includes all aspects of treatment from a nutritious diet, right exercise, stress busting techniques such as meditation, right breathing, music therapy, etc, in a targeted approach to not only reduce pain and inflammation but also to boost emotional health.</p>
    </p> 
    <p class="heading">Survivorship Program</p>
    <p class="contained">There is life after cancer; Fortis’ unique Survivorship Program believes this and helps cancer survivors to reclaim their life after their ordeal. Under this hand-holding program, adult cancer patients who are diagnosed early and go through the initial treatment process, are monitored and supported even after they are declared cancer-free. This support system helps them cope with a normal routine, manage their diet and nutrition, and generally help them in their recovery to prevent any possibility of a relapse.</p>
